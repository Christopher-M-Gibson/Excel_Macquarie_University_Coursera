# Addressing Business Problems with Excel

Excel is a spreadsheet software utilized by many across the globe. It is a key tool in data analysis and visualization. In this repository are various spreadsheets, where I use Microsoft Excel and many of its functions to solve business problems related to data analysis and visualization. 

### Note  
These workbooks originally came from the Excel Data Analysis and Visualization Specialization provided by Macquarie University on Coursera. The workbooks in this repository are a mix of the weekly challenges (which are ungraded), and reformated assignments. I do not intend this to be used as a cheating tool, as I reformatted the quiz workbooks to make them less compatible with the quizzes on Coursera. This repository is meant to add an Excel-based project in my portfolio. I highly recommend this specialization, as it provides high-quality instruction, practice quizzes associated with each lecture video to help grasp Excel concepts quicker, and loads to opportunities to practice the course material.

### Things to Note About How Each Workbook is Formatted  

1) Workbook: Each workbook represents a different business problem. I use Excel features in each one to help the solve the problem illustrated in the workbook, which is given in the workbook. 

2) Name of Workbook: The name of each workbook contains a brief overview of the contents of the workbook, as well as the main concepts covered in the workbook (in parenthesis).
For example, a workbook maybe titled "Cleaning an HR Database - (Time/Date Functions)"

3) Instructions Tab: Each workbook contains multiple tabs. The first tab is the Instructions Tab. This tab provides an overview of the steps that were performed in the workbook, and what tab(s) they were performed in. It serves as documentation, since it is hard to document work performed in Excel. Note that the Instructions Tabs in the Practice Challenge workbooks were created by the University of Macquarie, and I created the Instructions tabs for the quiz assignments.
