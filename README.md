# Addressing Business Problems with Microsoft Excel

Microsoft Excel is a spreadsheet software utilized by many across the globe. It is a key tool in data analysis and visualization. In this repository are various spreadsheets, where I use Microsoft Excel and many of its functions to solve fictional business problems related to data analysis and visualization. 

### Note  
These workbooks originally came from the Excel Data Analysis and Visualization Specialization provided by Macquarie University on Coursera. These workbooks originally were designed to be used for the Practice Challenges and Weekly quizzes. I have reformatted the workbooks, adding a fictional scenario that the workbook addresses. I highly recommend this specialization, as the lectures are informative, concise, and there is ample opportunity to practice the materials learned.

### Things to Note About How Each Workbook is Formatted  

1) Workbook: Each workbook represents a different (fictional) business scenario. I use Excel features in each one to help the solve the problem that is detailed in the workbook.

2) Name of Workbook: The name of each workbook contains a brief overview of the contents of the workbook, as well as the main Excel concepts covered in the workbook (in parenthesis). For example, a workbook may be titled "Zenco HR Database (Text Functions)". It deals with Zenco (a fictional company) and their HR Database, and the business problem's solution focuses on the use of text functions.

3) Instructions Tab: Each workbook contains multiple tabs. The first tab is the Instructions Tab. This tab provides an overview of the steps that were performed in the workbook, and what tab(s) they were performed in. It serves as documentation, since it is hard to document work performed in Excel. Note that the Instructions Tabs in the Practice Challenge workbooks were created by the University of Macquarie, and I created the Instructions tabs for the quiz assignments. (Although, I did add a scenario line that provides an imaginary context to the workbook and its purpose).
